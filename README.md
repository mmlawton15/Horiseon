# challenge-one-pineapple

## What is the point of this HTML code and page?
This is my submission for the 1st challenge in my coding boot camp. It mimics a company's webpage and existing HTML and CSS, which I was tasked with refactoring to match the requested criteria.

## Stack?
- HTML
- CSS

## What did I do?
I did alot of proofreading, edits and rearranging to the original code (downloaded from GitLab) to make it fully functional and match the Acceptance criteria. My code included:
- Creating new SSH keys to set up communication between my local computer and my GitHub Repository, titled challenge-one-pineapple.
- Adding the title to the webpage, so the tab read what the company name and home screen. This is for accessibility purposes.
- Added a few punctuation marks to the css to include certain fonts.
- Made the SEO button send the user to the correct section when clicked, as it didn't before.
- Rearranging the CSS style sheet to roughly match the HTML code, so if another developer needs to make an edit the order of the code is congruent.
- Added alt text to all of the images for accessibility purposes.

## What does it look like?
